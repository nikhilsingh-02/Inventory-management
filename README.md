**Overview**

This program manages a simple stock and inventory database for a project I made in class 11th. It uses MySQL as the database backend and Python's mysql.connector module to interact with the database. 
The main objective is to create and maintain three tables: Stock, Condemnation, and Issue, to store and manage the data related to product stocks, condemnations, and issued items.

**Features**

Stock Table: 
      Records product details including product number, voucher number, dealer name, type, quantity, rate, tax, and net amount.
      
Condemnation Table: 
      Tracks condemned products, including product and voucher numbers, type, quantity, and condemnation date.
      
Issue Table: 
      Records products issued to teachers, including voucher number, type, quantity, issue date, and return date.
